<p>Tai (aka “Thái Cực” aka “Merrida” aka “Bleachy Towel”) is a cuddly af
8 and a half year-old calico originally from South Brooklyn, and she
needs a new place to live.</p>

<p>Tai and her brother were caught when they were about 6-months old,
and after a vet workup/spay/nuetering I adopted the two of them. They
moved with me out to California. They’ve been living with me indoors the
whole time.</p>
<p>I think Tai is the smart and perceptive one of the pair. She’s
certainly the most gentle. While she doesn’t like to get picked up (she
wiggles and grubmles), she really likes to climb on top of me when I lie
down. Your mileage may vary, but I’m used to her jumping on top of me in
about 1-5 minutes after I go to bed, every night. So if you want a
cuddly fur baby cat, that’s Tai.</p>
<p><strong>The problem</strong> is that her brother (grey cat pictured)
is aggressive and excited and I can’t seem to tire him out enough to
keep him from play-attacking Tai. The vet recommended feeding the
brother cat psychiatric meds, but I instead figure that it’s finally
time to break up the band and split the pair. I love both these cats
dearly, but since Tai is the most mellow-mannered, chill, and “cat-like”
of the two I figured it’d be easier to find her a calm and safe home to
enjoy - with you!</p>

<p>Tai is in good health. I just got her some optional dental work done
at the vet (Feb 4th 2025), some teeth cleaning and optional <a
href="https://www.vet.cornell.edu/departments-centers-and-institutes/cornell-feline-health-center/health-information/feline-health-topics/tooth-resorption">FORL</a>
extractions. She was a little overweight last year, but at last weigh-in
she was within normal range. She has had a UTI in the past, so on the
vet’s recommendation I make sure to add 2 tablespoons of water to her
food to make sure she’s drinking enough water. This might not be of any
use when she’s on her own, as she should have safer/calmer access to
water without her brother around. Tai has had whatever vaccines the vet
offered, she’s spayed, and she also has a microchip (that of course we
can re-register to you).</p>
<p>When her brother’s not around, Tai likes to play with string or
little stuffed animals. She’ll do the thing where she’ll paw at it and
then leap in the air in suprise. She loves the laser and treats and
eating. I’ve fed them Friskie’s pate forever, and used to feed them
boiled chicken breast regularly. To warn you, I caught her once eating a
loaf of bread - she chewed through the plastic and was gorging herself
on the carbs. So you might have to hide your bread loaves. Also cooked
pasta, she’ll eat pasta if you give it to her (she does not know how to
prepare it herself!), but of course she prefers any sort of
meat/fish/broth or any dairy products (cheese, yogurt, cottage cheese,
egg). She does seem to respond a bit to catnip, and she does enjoy a
nice cat grass salad.</p>
<p>I call her Tai as short for Thái Cực. “Thái Cực”, I believe, is the
Vietname words for what is more commonly written in English as Tai Chi,
which I believe is the tradition that involves the yin-yang symbol. I
decided to call her that because her face reminds me of a yin-yang, with
the light and dark fur in a swirl around her chin/mouth/upper-lip. She
is also the “yin” to her brothers “yang”, she flows around conflict.</p>

<p>I very much love this cat and want to find her a happy and harmonious
long-term loving home. So, if you take her for a while but then decide
that it’s not a good fit, I will definitely take her back to make sure
she’s in a happy spot.</p>
<p>So if you’ve got room in your heart and home for this lovely 8.5
year-old cat, preferrably with a warm spot in the sunlight, please email
me to set up a visit. ” usual.flag9239 ” at that ” fastmail.com ”
